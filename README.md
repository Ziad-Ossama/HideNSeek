About the Project
HideNSeek is a Python-based steganography application that allows users to hide and extract data within images (PNG, JPG, JPEG) and GIFs. Featuring a modern, dark-themed GUI built with CustomTkinter, HideNSeek combines security, usability, and style. Whether you're concealing sensitive files or exploring steganography, HideNSeek offers a seamless experience with encryption, drag-and-drop support, and detailed operation history.
Key Features:

üñºÔ∏è Image Steganography: Embed and extract data in PNG, JPG, or JPEG files using LSB techniques.
üéûÔ∏è GIF Steganography: Hide data in GIFs with frame-based encoding.
üîê Fernet Encryption: Secure your data with symmetric encryption.
üõ°Ô∏è Authentication: Add passwords and author metadata.
üìÇ Drag-and-Drop: Easily load files via drag-and-drop.
üìú Operation History: Track all actions in a dedicated tab.
‚è≥ Progress Tracking: Animated progress bars with time estimates.
üåê Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

HideNSeek is perfect for users who want to securely share data in plain sight, wrapped in a sleek and intuitive interface.
Built With

Python
CustomTkinter
Pillow
Cryptography
TkinterDnD2


Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up HideNSeek on your local machine.
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher: Ensure Python is installed. Download from python.org.
pip: Python‚Äôs package manager (usually included with Python).

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hidenseek.git
cd hidenseek


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs:

customtkinter: For the GUI.
pillow: For image and GIF processing.
numpy: For array operations in steganography.
cryptography: For Fernet encryption.
tkinterdnd2: For drag-and-drop functionality.


Run the Application:
python main.py

The app will launch in a 900x700px window with a dark-themed interface.



Usage
HideNSeek is designed for ease of use, with a tabbed interface to handle different tasks. Here‚Äôs how to use it:
1. Launch the App
Run main.py to open the GUI. The sidebar includes four tabs: Image-Stego, GIF-Stego, History, and Help.
2. Embed Data

Select a Carrier:
In the Image-Stego or GIF-Stego tab, click Browse Image/GIF or drag-and-drop a carrier file (PNG/JPG/JPEG for Image-Stego, GIF for GIF-Stego).


Choose Data to Hide:
Click Browse Files or drag-and-drop up to 20 files to embed.


Set Encryption Key:
Enter a key or click Generate to create one (automatically copied to clipboard).


Add Authentication (Optional):
Enter a password and author name.


Embed:
Click Embed Data and save the output file (PNG or GIF).
Monitor the progress bar and estimated time.



3. Extract Data

Load Stego File:
Select the stego image/GIF via Browse Image/GIF or drag-and-drop.


Enter Key and Password:
Provide the encryption key and password (if used) from the embedding step.


Extract:
Click Extract Data and choose an output folder.
Extracted files are saved in a subfolder named Extracted_[carrier-name]_[timestamp].



4. View Metadata

Load Stego File:
Select the stego image/GIF.


Enter Key and Password:
Provide the encryption key and password.


View Metadata:
Click View Metadata to see the embedded author and timestamp.



5. Check History

Go to the History tab to view a log of all operations, including timestamps, operation type, and details.

For more detailed instructions, click the Help tab in the app.

Technical Details
Steganography Techniques

Image Steganography:
Uses Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding to hide data in pixel values.
Minimizes visual distortion by altering only the least significant bits.


GIF Steganography:
Embeds data across GIF frames, leveraging frame-based encoding.
Preserves GIF animation functionality.



Security Features

Encryption:
Uses Fernet (symmetric encryption) from the cryptography library.
Requires a key for both embedding and extraction.


Authentication:
Optional password protection and author metadata.


Integrity Checks:
Computes SHA-256 hashes to detect tampering.



Performance

Threading: Handles long tasks (embedding/extraction) in separate threads to keep the GUI responsive.
Progress Tracking: Displays real-time progress with animated bars and time estimates.
Memory Management: Implements cleanup methods and garbage collection to free resources.

UI Design

Built with CustomTkinter.
Dark theme with green buttons (#4CAF50, hover: #388E3C).
Fixed window size (900x700px), non-resizable.
Sidebar navigation with tabbed content.

Project Structure

main.py: Core app with GUI and logic.
img.py: SteganographyLogic for image steganography.
gif.py: GIFSteganographyLogic for GIF steganography.
history.json: Stores operation history.
assets/: Contains screenshots and demo GIFs.
requirements.txt: Lists dependencies.


Roadmap

 Support for additional file formats (e.g., BMP, MP4).
 Batch processing for embedding multiple carriers.
 Advanced encryption options (e.g., AES-256).
 UI themes and customization.
 Integration with cloud storage for saving stego files.
